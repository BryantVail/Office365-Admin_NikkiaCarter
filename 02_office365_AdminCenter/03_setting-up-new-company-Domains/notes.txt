    microsoft domain

    buying a new domain 
        takes to GoDaddy
            then adds to domain list

        "add domain" button
            1) enter domain 
            2) verify domain 
                a) verify ownership
                b) "mx" record also ok
            3) verify dns provider
                can choose one 
                not in the list
                    can also just choose a random one 
        goDaddy is pretty much instantaneous 
            some may take longer
            15min is a good time to wait
